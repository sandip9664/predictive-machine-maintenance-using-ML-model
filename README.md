This project develops a predictive maintenance model to anticipate machine failures and classify their specific types. Utilizing an Optimized Random Forest Classifier, the model achieves high performance, demonstrating robust F1 scores for both binary classification (failure vs. no failure) and multi-class classification (identifying specific failure types like Power Failure, Overstrain Failure, etc.).

Key Findings:
High Predictive Accuracy: The optimized Random Forest model yielded F1 scores of approximately 0.9840 for binary classification and 0.9806 for categorical failure type classification.

Critical Features: Operational parameters such as Torque [Nm], Rotational speed [rpm], and Tool wear [min] were consistently identified as the most influential features in predicting both the occurrence and type of machine failure.

Practical Application: This model can be integrated into real-time monitoring systems to enable proactive maintenance, significantly reduce machine downtime, and extend equipment lifespan by predicting potential issues before they escalate.
